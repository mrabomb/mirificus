If you want to look at the python code, just open 'Mirificus Code.py' and have a look.
If you just want to play the game, extract 'Mirificus 1.0.rar' and run 'Play.exe'. Its that easy

For those of you who check out the code, I apologise in advance. It is far from beautiful.
 This project was how I learned not just python, but programming in general.
 
My thanks to the wonderful guys who made cx_freeze for giving me the ability to freeze the python script
 in order to provide a distributable executable. You guys rule! (although you probably won't read this)
